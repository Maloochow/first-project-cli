# FirstProject

Welcome to the Healthy Weather gem! This is a weather teller with huge personality. It will encourage you to go outside when the weather is nice (or meh) and protect you from horrible weather. Have fun! But don't rely on it too much. 

To interact with this little buddy, run `bin/first_project_exec.rb`.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'first_project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install first_project

## Usage

Make sure you run "bundle install" before you wake up the Heathy Weather gem.
When you are ready, run `bin/first_project_exec.rb` to start.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spect` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/first_project_exec` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
